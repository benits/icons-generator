## Development | Getting started

1. Create a figma personal access token and add it to a .env file prefixed by `FIGMGA_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=`.
   - learn about generating a file token at https://www.figma.com/developers/docs#access-tokens
2. Add the file key for the figma design kit to a .env file prefixed by `DESIGN_KIT_FILE_KEY=`.
   - learn about how to find the file key at https://www.figma.com/developers/docs#get-files-endpoint

ie. (note, these are example values and not real keys)

```
// .env
FIGMGA_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=3513-4197ff56-fd89-3475-7894-3254jk3534j
DESIGN_KIT_FILE_KEY=YDuss21DSA89SDSAdfsDS9c4
```

You should then be able to run the `dev-build` script locally with the following command.

```sh
yarn run dev-build
```

This command will fetch the icons from figma, and generate a react package under `./packages/icons`.
